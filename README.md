# Traffic-Light-Control-Embedded-system-STM32
A traffic light control system with an STM32 microcontroller in an individual project. 
Programmed in C using a state machine model to manage traffic flows at an intersection.
The system used buttons for inputting traffic status and controlled the lights via two 8-bit shift registers over an SPI interface.
